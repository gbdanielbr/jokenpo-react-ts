## Front-End Development Challenge

### Description:
In this branch I develop a game logic that will permit more than two players in the game.

In this repository I develop a 'Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock' game as a challenge using TypeScript and ReactJS. The objective is to develop the game for two players, receive their choices and then shows the winner. I also implemented a score counting logic and a reset button.
